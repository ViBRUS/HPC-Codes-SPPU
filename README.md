# HPC-Codes-SPPU
SPPU Practical Codes of subject **High Performance Computing**. [*BE-comp 7th Semester*]


## Assignment 1:
a) Implement **Parallel Reduction using Min, Max, Sum and Average** operations.
b) Write CUDA programs that, given an *N-element vector*, find Home Faculty of Engineering Savitribai Phule Pune University Syllabus for Fourth Year of Computer Engineering.
1. The **maximum** element in the vector.
2. The **minimum** element in the vector.
3. The **arithmetic mean** of the vector.
4. The **standard deviation** of the values in the vector.

Test for input N and generate a randomized vector V of length N (N should be large). The program should generate output as the two computed maximum values as well as the time taken to find each value.

## Assignment 2:
Vector and Matrix Operations Design parallel algorithm to
1. **Add two** large vectors.
2. Multiply **Vector and Matrix**.
3. Multiply two N Ã— N arrays using n2 processors.

## Assignment 3:
Parallel Sorting Algorithms for **Bubble Sort and Merger Sort**, based on existing sequential algorithms, design and implement *parallel algorithm* utilizing all resources available.

## Assignment 4:
Parallel Search Algorithm- 
Design and implement **parallel algorithm** utilizing all resources available. For 
1. Binary Search for Sorted Array
2. Depth-First Search (tree or an undirected graph ) 
3. Breadth-First Search ( tree or an undirected graph)
